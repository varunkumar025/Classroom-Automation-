Classroom Automation with IoT, Blynk App, and Custom Android App- Revamp
This project aims to automate classroom processes using IoT (Internet of Things) technology, Blynk App, and a custom Android application. The system enables efficient management of classroom resources, such as lights, fans, projectors, and attendance tracking, through a user-friendly mobile interface.

Features
Control lights, fans, and other electrical devices in the classroom remotely using the Blynk App.
Automate the scheduling of devices based on predefined time slots.
Monitor and maintain optimal classroom temperature and humidity.
Track student attendance using QR codes and a custom Android application.
Generate attendance reports for individual students or entire classes.
Hardware Requirements
IoT board (such as Arduino or NodeMCU)
Sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Relays for controlling electrical devices
QR code scanner or webcam for attendance tracking
Software Requirements
Blynk App (available on Android and iOS)
Arduino IDE or Raspberry Pi programming environment
Android Studio for custom Android application development
